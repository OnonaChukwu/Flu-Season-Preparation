## Challenges and Motivations

### Influenza threatens US population
- High mortality rate and economic strain

### Avoidable deaths occur
- Compromise healthcare sector

## Severe economic burden
- Low workforce productivity
- High health insurance costs

## Aims
## Offer evidence-based enhancing vaccination strategies
## Mitigate the spread of flu across the population in the USA

## Objectives
### Identify key trends and risk factors through data analysis
### Test mortality rate between old and young population (H1)
### Compare influenza infestation rates by gender (H2)
### Compare mortality rate with regional population density

### MS PPT ( for data story and presentations)
### MS Word (for writing and noting project steps)

## Methodology
## Step 1: Data quality assessment with Excel
#### Data cleaning + integration
#### Data transformation

## Step 2: Descriptive analyses with Excel
### Age and gender
### Death counts by states

## Step 3: Deployed story telling using
### MS PPT + Tableau + Results presentations

## 85 years and above are more vulnerable to influenza infestation

## No statistical difference between female and male infestation rates

## High regional mortality rate is associated with high population density

## Project key findings

## 85+ years are most vulnerable to influenza infestation; elderly-targeted pre-season preparation be beneficial

## Male and female populations influenza infestation rates are same; universal approach to vaccination will fit

## Regional mortality rates are positively correlated with population density; region-targeted vaccination efforts could be beneficial

## Conclusions
### Average death count from influenza in the US is 34 per State; this is huge
### There is a notable impact on aged populations and more dense regions
### Proper and effective influenza vaccination program could be implemented
### Reducing the annual burden of influenza is possible with the evaluated data 
### More health workers should be deployed in more densely populated states
